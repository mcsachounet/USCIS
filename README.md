EAD delay with USCIS are currently insane (i am writing this in 2021). Quick py Script to show your position in the queue when waiting for your authorization of work (I765).
The script is giving you 1/ the cases approved out of 2/the total cases around you.
You can define the parameter n ie the number of cases around your case number you want to check.
The output = 2 lists and 2 dicts with the  neighbor's numbers
